# LOFI

![](https://github.com/jacbz/lofi/actions/workflows/client.yml/badge.svg)

LOFI is a ML-supported lo-fi music generator. We trained a VAE model in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) to represent a lo-fi track as a vector of 100 features. A lo-fi track consists of chords, melodies, and other musical parameters. The web client uses [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) to make a dusty lo-fi track out of these parameters.

## Architecture

* **Client**: The client is written in TypeScript and built with Webpack. It uses Tone.js to generate music.
* **Model**: The model is implemented in PyTorch. We synthesized various datasets, including Hooktheory and Spotify.
* **Server**: The server is a basic Flask instance that deploys the trained model checkpoint. The client communicates with the Server using a REST API.
